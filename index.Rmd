# Preliminary Information {-}

This is an artificial book to demonstrate the look of the 
[Bookdown Template](https://github.com/jxareas/Bookdown-Template), which is a template to rapidly deploy either Python or R based books using Bookdown.

As this uses R Markdown, Python must be used through the `reticulate` interface.
